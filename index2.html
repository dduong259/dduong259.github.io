            I am sorry I was not able to come home on Thursday or this weekend. Programmer life has me busy.
            This is part of an assignment I have to do, but I hope you will like this.
            <br /><br />
            I am proud of your part in raising me. I know you did your best to raise me correctly throughout
            whatever times we went through, and you did in fact raise me correctly. I am grateful that you
            have helped present me my life. As a Mom, you always worry, and while I may never fully understand
            what that is like, I am now doing my best to help your concerns. Thank you Mom.

            If you want to save these pages, click the below link to download a .zip file of these 3 pages.
            It's also hosted on my GitHub, and it'll probably stay there for a while.

            So as it turns out, I still need a 3rd page for my assignment. I'm already done with your part, 
            <a href="index3.html">so there's really only one thing to do in this situation.</a>
